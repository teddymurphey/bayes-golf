    "### Developing Bayesian Prior Distributions\n",
    "The first step in creating a bayesian updating model for golf prediction is the development of a prior distribution. We accomplish this by computing average distributions from historically unbiased tournaments. We select the 2022 CJ Cup as its adjusted score relative to par was just +0.05, a significantly low differential. The advantage of using an unbiased tournament is that golfers performed exceptionally close to \"normal.\" Golf course metrics such as slope rating and course rating (which we will use) are based on \"normal\" scoring."

That is, for the example of a birdie, we need to find the chance that a plus-handicapper makes a birdie, plus a 0-handicapper, plus a 1-handicapper, ..., plus a 53-handicapper, plus a 54-handicapper. This sum will give us the denominator."
